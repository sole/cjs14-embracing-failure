First, ensure you have the following installed:

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
2. [Bower](http://bower.io): `$ npm install -g bower`
3. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com): `$ npm install -g grunt-cli`

Then, install dependencies and run the preview server:

```bash
$ npm install && bower install
$ grunt server
```

To generate the things for uploading just run `grunt`.

This presentation was built with [generator-bespoke](https://github.com/markdalgleish/generator-bespoke), and a couple of extra plugins I built, if you were curious about it.
